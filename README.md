# PDF Intelligence Starter Repo

This starter repo contains three components:

- `python-service/` - a small Python microservice for ingesting PDFs and exposing a simple API.
- `server/` - a Spring Boot Java server providing backend endpoints (stub).
- `client/` - a React frontend that can upload PDFs and ask questions (stub).

Each component has minimal starter code and instructions in its own README.
