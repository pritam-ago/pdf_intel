Client

React client (Parcel) that uploads PDFs to the backend.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies: run "npm install" in the client folder.
2. Run the dev server: run "npm run dev".

The client expects backend APIs under /api/. Run the Spring Boot server on port 8080 and configure a proxy when using Parcel.
